# 🚀 GrowthProAI – Business Dashboard

Hi there! 👋  

I'm Yugandhar Chamana, currently building projects like this to improve my skills and become a better full-stack developer. Thanks for checking it out! 

This is a mini full-stack dashboard I built as part of an intern assignment at GrowthProAI. It's a local business dashboard that shows some business info along with an AI-generated SEO headline. I used React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.
